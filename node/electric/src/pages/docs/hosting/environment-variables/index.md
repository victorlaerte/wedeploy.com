## Reference

Here's a list of all the environment variables you can use with this service.

<div class="table-container">

| Key | Default Value | Description |
| - | - | - |
| WEDEPLOY_WEB_PATH | `./` | Path to serve static files |
| WEDEPLOY_WEB_ERROR_PATH | `./_error` | Path to serve [error pages](/docs/hosting/custom-error-pages/) |

</div>

**Usage:**

Here are the environment variables in action within a `wedeploy.json`.

```application/json
{
	"id": "myservice",
	"image": "wedeploy/hosting:@site.version.image.hosting@",
	"env": {
		"WEDEPLOY_WEB_PATH": "./dist",
		"WEDEPLOY_WEB_ERROR_PATH": "./myerrors",
	}
}
```

###### <span class="icon-16-alert"></span> Attention

The folder specified in `WEDEPLOY_WEB_PATH` will be resolved relative to the folder where the `wedeploy.json` is located. In the example below, if `WEDEPLOY_WEB_PATH` is specified as `./dist`, then the `dist` folder must be next to `wedeploy.json` in the root of that service directory.

```
myapp
  ├── wedeploy.json
  ├── dist
  └── src
```
