### Auth

###### {$page.description}

## Introduction

Our Auth service allows you to avoid the headache of operating your own user management system. Features like creating accounts, resetting passwords, and updating profiles are easily accomplished with a few lines of code.

Check for new releases to our Auth Image on our [Updates page](/updates/services/auth).

## Configuring

<aside>

All WeDeploy projects use similar configuration files to prepare your projects for deployment. Learn more on our page about <strong><a href="/docs/deploy/getting-started/">Getting Started with Deploying</a></strong>.

</aside>

Below is an example of a `wedeploy.json` for an Auth container.

```application/json
{
	"id": "users",
	"image": "wedeploy/auth:@site.version.image.auth@"
}
```

The `id` for your services are uniquely determined by you.
