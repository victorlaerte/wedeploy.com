## Configuring

<aside>

All WeDeploy projects use similar configuration files to prepare your projects for deployment. Learn more on our page about <strong><a href="/docs/deploy/getting-started/">Getting Started with Deploying</a></strong>.

</aside>

Below is an example of a `wedeploy.json` for a Ruby container. The `id` for your services are uniquely determined by you.

```application/json
{
	"id": "myservice"
}
```

You need to place a `wedeploy.json` wherever you have a `Gemfile`. If you were deploying a Ruby application, this is what your project could look like:

```xml
myservice
├── Gemfile
└── wedeploy.json
```
