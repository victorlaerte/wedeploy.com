#### {$page.title}

Before we can make any requests to our Data service, we must connect the WeDeploy API Client.

To do this, go back to the `ui` folder and include this script link near the bottom of the `<body>` element in the `index.html` file.

```xml
<script src="https://cdn.wedeploy.com/api/@site.version.api.javascript@/wedeploy.js"></script>
```
