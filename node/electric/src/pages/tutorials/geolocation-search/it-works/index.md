##### Deploy

Now that your API requests are ready, you can deploy your project again so that the changes are live.

```xml
we deploy -p projectID
```

##### See It Live

Great work, your app is ready to be used! Now let's start searching for bars in Cleveland.

1. Go to `ui-<projectID>.wedeploy.io` in your browser.
2. Now try typing something in the search bar.

Awesome! You just deployed an application that searches for businesses based on their location within a few minutes! We can't wait to see what else you create with WeDeploy!

###### <span class="icon-16-star"></span> Pro Tip

Wanting to make a pretty url for your primary UI service without purchasing a custom domain? Perfect, you can go to the _Custom Domain_ section of your service on the Dashboard and add a custom domain that ends with `wedeploy.io` (e.g. `yourapp.wedeploy.io`).
