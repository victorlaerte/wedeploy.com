Now that our WeDeploy API is setup, we must activate our Google Maps API by adding a unique key.

1. Go to <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard" target="_blank">the Google API Console</a>
2. Select the _Credentials_ tab
3. Click on _Create Credentials_ (API Key)
4. Copy the key and paste into the Google Maps script link near the bottom of your `index.html` file.
